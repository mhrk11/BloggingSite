            <h1> Accountability.</h1>
            <p>I have a certain liking to emotional music, not the usual Bollywood crap but the instrumental ones, the masterpieces that are abundant in YouTube. They help me to imagine. Everything that I have written so far in Medium had the same music playing in the background. I can pretty much say, the best way to get the feel of my writing would be to tune it in and read this blog too.</p>
            <p>It has been a while the last time wrote. It is not like I have an audience that I need to strive for. Maybe that’s why I take this for granted: the lack of accountability. I have never experienced a more motivating factor than accountability; of course, after curiosity. </p>
            <p>The first time when I uploaded a review about 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C Clark on my Instagram, I couldn’t believe the reward shots I got. It was so inspiring that I read one after another book and posted it in Insta. It is not that I just wanted to post, I read it wholeheartedly, alright I am exaggerating but I felt validated as if my action of reading mattered. It, of course, did even if I didn’t post, but this way it felt more motivating and I wanted to do more. One after another book I read. One after another review I wrote. A book a week. It was great. And then Exams came in, and everything fucked up and I lost the cycle, but later on that part. </p>
            <p>I have about 11 books in my Insta that I read and reviewed in less than three months. And now compare to that to every book I have read until the first book I posted, around twenty and most of them are crap, nor do I think I remember most of the stuff in it. Now compare to the new books I read. Here are the standards that I have set to myself: first, I am posting it in Insta so there is this natural instinct to read more than just “How to be happy in life” kinda self-help book, a good material; I have to write a review about how I felt it in the most concise language because Insta isn’t good for posting essays so the added responsibility of reading material thoroughly; third, Insta is rewarding and I can’t get the rewards until I finish the book so the added pace; fourth, people watch you and they react and you don’t wanna lose them, consistency. </p>
            <p>Of all the self-help I have ever done, I definitely put this process among the top of my list. It was a great idea that I saw someone doing in Insta. I copied the idea and added my touch. The dude who used to do that was another self-help nerd, probably too nerdy. I wanted to give it a human touch. I am nobody’s personal motivator because I am full of crap myself and those who claim aren’t, are more than me, I know. They tell lies, they hide their fallacies, they will sell honesty by being dishonest. That’s what most people do, I have seen them and also became of one of them. I don’t know if I am still one of them, but I wish I am not. If I ever become, probably you will help me, the people who I am accountable to.<p>
