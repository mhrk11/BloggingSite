            <h1> Belief.</h1>
            <p>The most difficult aspect of writing a blog isn’t actually writing. For me, it is the starting — the willingness to open a document and write the first sentence. I usually know where to go after that. It is very simple: you just don’t let any boundaries to your imagination, never state a theme already, just remain uncertain and pour down everything that goes in your head. Am I doing the same now? Yes. And you see, I have already written a paragraph, just writing about about-writing itself. So, how about we end this paragraph here and switch to the next one? </p>
<p>Okay. There is this new friend I made recently. She is nice, very smart, but she is cursed with knowledge. Knowledge of all sorts. Sometimes, I feel she should have known her limits. A moment is talking about her favorite book, and a sentence later she talks about neurology and the complex functioning of a human mind. She calls herself suffering from depression. She levels herself as an ADHD person. She thinks she also has some symptoms of Bipolar Disorder. I am surprised she is probably the first woman who I am talking without any intentions of coitus. Yeah, I am kind of a dick when it comes to women. My intentions are largely corrupted. But in her case, I am not, I am just curious. I am curious about how she thinks, why she levels herself with every depressing stuff, how can knowledge be a curse.</p>
<p>If you were to google three symptoms of fever, you would end up being suspicious if you have cancer. Suspicion is like a weed and it grows like bamboo. First, you are just curious if you have it, you play with the thoughts enough, feed it well with enough information and in no time, there it is your suspicion becoming a reality. That’s how leveling works. </p>
<p>I identified myself as an insomniac because I used to have trouble sleeping when I was in my gap years. I was going through a breakup then. As long as I can remember, I think I have always been in a breakup or two. So, I had gotten into this habit of numbing my pain by watching Movies, Listening Audio-books, and fapping at porn. The habit persisted. And I started calling myself an insomniac because first, it sounded cool to level a problem and second, enough people had it and they thought it was cool. What I have realized is the moment you start leveling yourself with identity, you start inheriting its traits too. The habit got worse. I would be awake fidgeting whole night because there is just so much you can do with movies and porn. There is no replacement for sleep. </p>
<p>I have struggled with the habit of sleeping long enough. And I am of course not a Kumbhakaran now either. But now, I no more identify myself with insomnia. I just let myself enjoy my sleeplessness some nights. I no more force myself to sleep. I just shut my eyes and let my mind unwind. There is no rush to go anywhere from my pillow. Not leveling has quite helped me over time. I just take responsibility for what is happening to me. I get about six hours of sleep at night. And I sleep about two hours during the day because I get exhausted due to the gym, and I enjoy the afternoon slumber. Just not leveling myself as an insomniac has helped me a lot with sleep. </p>
<p>So what happens when you level yourself with so many things? It can get worse. You victimize yourself enough, you are nearer to becoming one. This blog is definitely not about the power of positivism or gratitude. They have their own place. In fact, the dire need for positivity in life can fuck people quite badly. Saying a hundred times “Thank You” to your problems can make you feel good for a while but won’t solve anything and definitely leave a big hole in the heart. The point of this blog is about the profound virtuality we are creating with the information in our finger-tips. There is definitely not a single argument when it comes to the human mind and philosophy that can’t be debated upon. That’s why it becomes so important to chose a belief or level oneself with something that helps us the most. Because we become what we believe in. </p>
