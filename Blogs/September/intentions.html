            <h1> Intentions.</h1>
            <p> I dared myself to write a blog yesterday. And I wrote it too. The only good thing about that blog was that I wrote it anyway. But it wasn’t any near to the blogs that I have written before. It was messy. It didn’t have my tone. And it was difficult for me to even write a sentence. Even though I had the idea clear in my head, I couldn’t express it in its truest form. </p>
<p>This is something I suffer from time to time. I have many skills that I have learned over the years but I didn’t continue any of them. Mostly I start things out of desperation. It would be during my exam preparation holidays and I would be forcing myself to find time to code, play guitar, write and read books; and now I am in post-exam holidays, I am wasting it like a man who has all-time in the world.</p>
<p>I don’t wanna force myself to do anything. I, of course, want myself to enjoy the process of learning as much as I can. But most of the times, it seems my intentions are more aligned in getting the validation of people (especially women) than actually work itself. Why do I seek for validation stems down to its own roots of being sensitive and “nice”. I am not blaming my parenting or childhood for any psychological traits that I have, but I can’t deny the inevitable. I was raised by my mother, well everyone is but my case is that I spent more of my time with her feelings, her sentiments, her pain, her loneliness where I never got to have a good relationship with my father (we are alright though). My father mostly gave me that conditioned parenting: threatening, setting expectations and standard for me to be able to get his approval, mostly rude with his behavior, always comparing with others and showing me how uselessly I was living with my life. I feel pain in writing this, but that’s just the way it is. Even if he never intended it, even if he did all those stoicism behaviors to make me more competitive, from a son’s perspective that’s how I perceived it, and that’s how I felt: a conditioned love. My mother, on the other, she made me a woman from inside: sensitive, empathetic, hopeful, perfection-seeker, thoughtful, and more loving: everything that is too nice for a man to have. In that process, I also learned to hide my intentions, suppressing my emotions, and I went out there faking who I wasn’t. </p>
<p>You can learn perfectionism, but recklessness is an innate trait and it is truest in its form. I don’t call myself a failure in any way, but I do feel sad about the fact that I allowed myself be defined by what others think about, I allowed myself to believe that I wasn’t worthy of any love and approval until I had proved myself to be significant among them. I remember whenever I would have an argument that required me to stand for myself, I would let the other person dominate me verbally thinking that I would prove to the person by being more successful in my professional life. It is total nonsense. It purely was my inability to stand for myself, for the right cause, for something I believed in. It was my fear of being contradicted, fear of being disliked, fear of getting into a fight.</p>
<p>I have started to come to believe that Masculinity is all about integrity and honesty. We may be dicks in our ways, but our intentions are clear. If more men were to inherent feminine characters, I am pretty sure this would be the world filled with Lord Baellish and Cersei tricks. They are good in politics, but they lack integrity. The point of being a man is to stand and fight for whatever we believe in; to remain true to oneself. And that means to present that idea even though it may offend others, ask that woman out even though we may get rejected, leave that job we don’t like even though it pays a gazillion. We may appear creepy, we may appear reckless, we may get into fights but that has its satisfaction of being beaten for what we are than being applauded for what we aren’t.</p>
