            <h1> Awkwardness.</h1>
            <p>It is around 8. I just came from Basant’s Auntie's hotel. I eat there. It is about half a kilometer far. Basanti Aunty is one of those women who are difficult to predict. She is an overall great human being, but she is moody. I presume most women are; otherwise, it is just that every woman I have met so far are coincidentally identical. She has two daughters: Soni And Samriddhi. And by the way, the hotel’s name is after Samriddhi, she is the younger one. You know, one of the privileges you get for being younger. Soni raises these issues often. Her concern is same as that of most elder ones: “I wasn’t allowed to do that when I was her age, why won’t anyone make her work, why do I always have to work, somebody say something to her…” </p>
<p>Families, you know, are tough to understand but that is what gives us our identity. That hotel is a small one. So small, that even the word ‘hotel’ is too big to describe it, it should be ‘ho’. We are about nine people who eat there. And not everyone is from my batch. I am the youngest one. But you could be easily confused if you ever were to see us together, you would call me I am the oldest. That’s the story of most families. My brother, who is about fours years younger than me, looks more muscular than me, and if he were to have a beard, anyone would call him elder but later you would know the truth after seeing who is getting more privileges. </p>
<p>We had a Farewell party yesterday in the ho. It was for the fourth year Brothers. Their exams have ended and so has their time in WRC. And soon or later, after their project completion, they would set out for their adventure. It was already 8 and the party hadn’t started. Auntie was trying to lie that that preparation wasn’t for farewell and acting all apathetic: one of those things we humans do to hide our excitement and try to act casual. I could feel her enthusiasm, her love that she put in to decorate that place, her new learned gait, her emotional gaze, and her without-punchline-jokes. I just loved her at that moment. The vulnerability that she showed to make that party happen was one of the most mesmerizing things I have felt. Soni was there too, but she was expressive about whatever she felt. And of course, there was Samriddhi too and she didn’t give a fuck. </p>
<p>One of the things about the ho is that the place doesn’t have the capacity for more than six people eating together. So all our individual timing to go there is different. We, me and my flatmate, go that place around 7:30. The final-year dais comes to that place around 8. Similarly, we all have our own routine to go to that place. But yesterday, we all were together. My flatmate is an under-appreciative cunt. He was constantly nagging and ranting about why do this and that. You know, how some people are. They are insecure about showing their emotions, so they chose to suppress it and then try to take it our with rants and anger. I feel sad for him because he can’t even enjoy the vulnerability that love brings. </p>
<p>All of us were waiting outside since Soni wanted to write “Happy Farewell” on the wall. I can tell you that was one of the worst calligraphy I have seen which she knew too, but the joy she had on her face was priceless. She welcomed us all in the ho. It was jammed and packed. If anyone had sneezed at that moment, the roof would have blown up. There was a little bit of photo session, some cakes, a little tika and a lot of food: Chicken, Rajma, Achar, Cold Drinks, Prawns and Fried Aalu.</p>
<p>We all ate together. It turns out the place can actually withstand all nine of us with Aunty and Soni.</p>
<p>After we finished eating. The guys made Soni give a speech. She couldn’t. But her tears said enough. I have always looked at that place as a place where I eat and pay. But it turns out, I was wrong all along. The guys have been coming to that place for four years. They eat, they talk, they share their home stories, they nag, they complain and they have been doing this for four years. Aunty does the same. She defines herself with the place and everyone’s who comes there. It isn’t just her profession, but a way of life. It was kinda a speechless moment. Nobody talked. But everyone shared and lost a part of themselves in it. During all these things were happening, my asshole flatmate was constantly nagging to go home and I had been shushing me, so he kept going in and out trying to hear and act as if not feel everything happening at the moment. It kind of started getting awkward until Aunty again cracked an unfunny joke, everyone gave nervous laughter. You have no idea how charming unfunny joke can get sometimes. All of the guys got up. And so did I.</p>
