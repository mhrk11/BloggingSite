            <h1> LazyAss.</h1>
                <p>I remember switching off the Cooler Last Night. It was getting cold, it was as if a cold wind was blowing from my legs to face. I got up, half-conscious, turned that circular button to ‘off’, grabbed the sheets and covered myself with it. Pranjal was lying by my side. I don’t think it mattered to him anyways. He can’t differentiate anything when he is asleep. I sometimes feel jealous about how easily he sleeps.</p>
                <p>I was there awake when he was about to doze-off. I was reading the book: “Thinking, Fast And Slow”. I must have finished about a page when I turned to check him. He was gone. Switched off, just like that. No need to take deep breathes. No need to meditate for five minutes in bed. No need to stretch. No urges to go to the bathroom for twenty-five times and still have the thought: Maybe, I should pee one more time. He went off just like that. And there I lied with the book in front of my face, turning light on and off, putting my book on and off, fidgeting with the sheets and thinking what I could do tomorrow.</p>
                <p>I reached home yesterday. I was supposed to be giving a back exam yesterday. But I left. I couldn’t do it. I was too stressed. I felt empty and occupied at the same time. It was one of those feelings that are strong and weak, shallow and deep, clear and vague, predictable and uncertain — all and all, I was confused and couldn’t see what I need to do next, so I left. I was spiteful, vengeful and needed some time to recover my emotional-self. And yes, if you are thinking that it has to do with my breakup. I was attached. And I gave an entire semester exam with pain. How long could I have pulled it off? I am only human. I may know the depth of the seas or vastness of the cosmos, but I still feel pain when exposed to my wounds.</p>
                <p>That day, when I decided that I couldn’t give my exams, I called Dad. I told him that I wanna come home. He said okay. He told me to come the next day. He didn’t know about my back-exam or breakup, of course. After a minute, I told him that I wanted to come home, I regretted my decision. How could I be so weak? How could I not take one more day of stress? I immediately called him back. I told him, I won’t come I have got some work. As expected, he was furious. I took out my notes and started studying. It got difficult with every next word I would read. I couldn’t cry. I couldn’t take out my anger. I talked to a few friends about my condition. Nothing happened. That darkness would no more fade. And then I talked to Kedar that I couldn’t take it anymore. He suggested to not to be so hard. If I can give exams next time, Physics wasn’t worth the stress or trauma. And I called dad again, told him I wanted to come back. He was happy, by the way. I was expecting a very vengeful reply because of which, I had called Mum first to be my backup, but he replied quite nicely. It was as if he wanted me to be home that’s why he was furious when I told him I won’t come home.</p>
                <p>I would stay home for a month or two. I have promised myself that I would ameliorate my emotional state, no matter what this time. To do that, I need to develop a strong sense of work. I mean, something I can create and put it out. Because as Sherlock famously puts it: Work is the best antidote to Sorrow. So, I need to employ myself. How can I do that? It is simple. Don’t be a Lazyass.</p>
