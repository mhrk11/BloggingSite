            <h1> Alright.</h1>
            <p>It was late in the morning when I woke up, probably 10 or near 11. I had this headache when I woke up, the ones you get when you compensate for your lack of sleep with masturbation. I have a very poor sleep cycle. I have tried many times to ameliorate my sleep but there is just so much I can do to change my environment.</p>
<p>My room partner likes to stay late. He has a problem incorporating anything healthy or sensible. He is among the one who believes in changing the world in one day, just one day. He will slack off the others. He had exams today. So, he stayed the whole night. And call it an excuse or anything, I can’t sleep with lights on, or when I can sense a human roaming freely around me.</p>
<p>So there was I with eyes closed in the desperation of hitting that switch off button. One of the worst things about sleep is the more you try to sleep, the more you get frustrated and sleep is unlikely to happen. I stayed there with my eyes squeezed wanking. I hate myself that I discovered in my teenage years that masturbation made the sleeping easier. It seriously doesn’t. But then, it did. And I got hardwired with the habit.</p>
<p>I have tried numerous times to go on Nofap. And always failed miserably. I even had a 30 days Vlog which revolved around the idea of quitting Masturbation and Pornography. I could only complete half the month and then I relapsed. It was horrible. After getting as long as 15 days, I relapsed. A few months back, I relapsed on my 17th day: that’s the furthest I got with Nofap.</p>
<p>During that phase of Nofap, I can say my energy was skyrocketed, though I would be horny all the time but it kinda was sexy in its own way. My sleep patterns were improved. I wanted to work out more. I wanted to wake up early. That excitement to go out there and talk with more people rouse drastically. The rationale mind shut down to the level that it no more interfered in the sexual decisions I would make: which is definitely a tricky thing, but I am glad I made sure I wasn’t all creepy and all. All I did was talked more openly to women that I wanted to talk to. It created that urgency for me and since I was beaming with energy, I wanted myself to be exposed, I was ready for any urgency. But it was also again those times when I could only pull off the habit until my environment backfired.</p>
<p>I would want to sleep at 10 or 11, but just because it would be important for me didn’t justify or how flatmates took their lives. There would be constant tussling and noise around. Lights on-off. The door opened and closed. Music on and off. There is just so much I could do. I got frustrated. Nofap already had made me deprived of dopamine. The Vlogs were getting hectic since I was in the middle of my assignment submission and internal exams. The cravings were just too much, I relapsed and slacked back to how my environment wanted me to stay.</p>
<p>My roommate mostly stays whole night watching YouTube, movies, series, or sometimes studying and wakes up around 11, 12 or 1 during the day. And I just got institutionalized. I have talked. And it isn’t as if, he doesn’t know. If you were to talk to him, he would inspire you for your life, about healthy lifestyle and all.</p>
<p>It was about this semester’s beginning. I got this strange cough. It has been already four months now. The doctors don’t know anything about it. They are mostly like: meh, it is just an infection. I had antibiotics for months. It slowed me down. I lost my weight way too much. I got more irritated, just imagine you are coughing the whole time you are trying to study, eat, walk or talk. Just imagine the first thing you do in the morning is a cough, and the last you do is cough. This became another reason for falling in the trap of poorer sleep. Because first, my roommate won’t let me get into my slumber and second, I couldn’t get past the cough.</p>
<p>I am sorry if you were expecting me to end this blog with a positive message. There is none. It is just the way it is. I don’t believe in fairy tales. I don’t believe that every path or every story has a happy ending. It is just that hope we live by. The hope that we would be better tomorrow. I don’t care about tomorrow. I am what I am now. A little messed. A little sick. A little Impatient but alright nonetheless.</p>
